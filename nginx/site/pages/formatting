The pagination system is quite simple; The /pages folder is the target root to look for the pages to be displayed
on the content div of the website. This system is based around the definition of JSON files containing the
information to be displayed on the website.

For the record, folders and file names do not matter at all, but are useful for organization purposes,
so you should still find a way to keep them coherent and structured.

---------------------------------- // ----------------------------------

The pages are organized in sections and subsections, so that there is a cohesive and understandable structure
and index for them. Each section has to be defined and it can then be referenced in the content files.

To create a section, a json file must be created following this base format:

```json
{
    type: "section",

    name: "example section name",
    namespace: "main",
    position: #,
    visible: boolean,
    index: boolean
}
```

Formatting legend:
- type: "section" (required)
    >   Defines the type of the json file so the system knows how to handle it.

- name: "example section name" (required)
    >   The name of the section to be displayed on the website.

- namespace: "main" (required)
    >   The namespace of the section, used to reference it in the content files and in the index, with the
    subsections declared in the content files.

- position: # (required)
    >   The position of the section in the index. Think of it as the "priority" of placement in the navigation.

- visible: boolean (optional)
    >   Whether the section is visible in the navigation or not. If not defined, the default value is true.

- index: boolean (optional)
    >   Whether the section contains an index or not. If not defined, the default value is true.

---------------------------------- // ----------------------------------

The pages in the website are represented by json files containing the information to be displayed,
with a basis on:

```json
{
    type: "page",

    section: {
        "namespace": "main.sub.sub.(...)",
        "subsection-name": "example subsection name",

    },
